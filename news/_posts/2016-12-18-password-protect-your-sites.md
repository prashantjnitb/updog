You asked, we listened!

A few members have asked for the ability to password protect the sites
they've created on updog.co, and now _all_ Pro members can!

When you create a site on updog.co, your site is only accessible
to those with whom you share the URL. In some cases, you might want
to allow others to see your site for a limited time.

## How to password protect your site

Click "Settings" for any one of your sites, and scroll down to the **Passcode** section.

This input will always be empty. **Importantly, UpDog does not store your password in
plaintext form**. That is, once you set a passcode on one of your sites, you will not
be able to retrieve the password - be sure to remember it!

## How to view your protected site

I created [this demo](https://passcode-demo.updog.co/) for you to see how passcode
protection works.

The passcode is **passcodedemo**
