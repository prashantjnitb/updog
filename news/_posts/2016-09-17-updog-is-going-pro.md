title: UpDog is Going Pro!
---

In the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing new features, upgrading hardware _and_
software to bring you the best UpDog yet.

To say thank you to everyone who has supported UpDog so far, here's a sneak peak
at what's to come:

- Automatic Markdown rendering
- Custom document roots
- Faster response times
- SSL Certificates for custom domains
- and more!

This is your chance to be heard and guide the direction of future UpDog development.
