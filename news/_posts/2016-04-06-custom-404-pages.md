You can now have custom 404 pages for your site!

Instead of responding with Dropbox's error: `file not found`,
you can create a `404.html` file and put whatever message you
like in there.

Here's an example: <https://jshawl.updog.co/non-existent-folder/>

Have a 404 page you'd like to show off? [let us know](/contact) and we'll feature it here!
