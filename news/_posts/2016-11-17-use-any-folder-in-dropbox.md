By default, UpDog will create a folder that only it (and you, of course) has access to.

As of today, Pro members can now use any folder in their Dropbox account to host
a site through UpDog.

## Link Your Full Dropbox Account

When [creating a new site](https://updog.co/new), you'll have the option to link
your entire Dropbox account. Clicking this button will ask your permission to
connect your account to UpDog.

[You can undo this at any time](http://www.wikihow.com/Unlink-an-App-in-Dropbox)

Once you've linked your account, you'll be presented with a list of folders in
your Dropbox account. Select the folder that contains your website:

Choose a name for your site, click save and add some HTML files to the folder you selected.

That's it!
