Starting today, any file named `favicon.ico` will be loaded as
the favicon for your site instead of the UpDog logo: ![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/k6dyf3ajdxk1tvq/Screenshot%202016-09-15%2009.33.00.png?dl=0)

As always, you can name your favicon whatever you like, though you'll need to link to it manually:

```html
<link rel="icon"
      type="image/png"
      href="http://example.com/myicon.png">
```
