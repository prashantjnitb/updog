title: Discontinuing Rendering of HTML Content
---

__UpDog will continue to function as normal__

On September 1st, 2016, an email arrived in my inbox:

>Hi Jesse,

>We’re writing to let you know that we’ll be discontinuing the ability to render HTML content in-browser via shared links or Public Folder. If you're using Dropbox shared links to host HTML files for a website, the content will no longer display in-browser.

>Please note that this change will take effect for your account on October 3, 2016, and only impacts how shared files are displayed on the web. Your files will remain safe in Dropbox.

>Thanks for being a loyal Dropbox user.

>&mdash; The Dropbox Team

### What this means for non-updog users

Instead of Dropbox links rendering HTML content, like:

![Rendered HTML](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/q63q0k8keg4hqd2/Screenshot%202016-09-11%2018.24.33.png?dl=0)

Viewers will see the raw HTML source code:

![Unrendered HTML](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ygstsvefsovvt23/Screenshot%202016-09-11%2018.25.32.png?dl=0)

Because UpDog uses the Dropbox API, your site and HTML files here will be unaffected.
