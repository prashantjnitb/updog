<h2>Password Protect Your Sites</h2>

  Note: a <a href="/pricing">Pro membership</a> is required for password protection.

<p>You asked, we listened!</p>

<p>A few members have asked for the ability to password protect the sites
they’ve created on updog.co, and now <em>all</em> Pro members can!</p>

<p>When you create a site on updog.co, your site is only accessible
to those with whom you share the URL. In some cases, you might want
to allow others to see your site for a limited time.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-password-protect-your-site">How to password protect your site</h2>

<p>Click “Settings” for any one of your sites, and scroll down to the <strong>Passcode</strong> section.</p>

<p>This input will always be empty. <strong>Importantly, UpDog does not store your password in
plaintext form</strong>. That is, once you set a passcode on one of your sites, you will not
be able to retrieve the password - be sure to remember it!</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://passcode-demo.updog.co/">this demo</a> for you to see how passcode
protection works.</p>

<p>The passcode is <strong>passcodedemo</strong></p>
