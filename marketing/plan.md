# Marketing Plan

## Before (Prospect)

### My Target Market

**Marcia the Meddler**. I know how to create a simple website, but am intimidated
by the number of steps I have to take and terms I have to learn required to get it online.

**Tightwad Timmy**. I have a website and want to spend as little money as possible
to keep it online.

**Non-Jekyller Ned**. I know git and coding, but I prefer a static site generator
other than Jekyll. I need an alternative to github pages.

<summary>Questions</summary>

>What keeps them awake at night?

How to share their web creations on their computers with the world. How to communicate
all the things they have to say?

>What are they afraid of?

Being made to feel dumb / incompetent enough to share their message. Spending
money on the wrong things to solve their problem.

>What are they angry about?

The number of steps it takes to get a website online:

- cPanel
- DNS
- Domains
- FTP
- Document Root
- Web Servers

>Who are they angry at?

- StackOverflow

>What are their top daily frustrations

Solving one problem only to uncover three more. e.g. I paid for a domain name,
but now I need a web host, an FTP client, and to configure a document root.

>What trends are occurring and will occur in their lives?

Publishing content exclusively on social media. Instead of creating a website,
it's much easier to post on FaceBook or Instagram

>What do they secretly desire most?

To be heard.

>Is there a built-in bias to the way they make decisions?

Have other people been successful with this approach? If __ __ can do it,
then so can I!

>Do they have their own language or jargon?

HTML, CSS, Browser, responsive design, design.

>What magazines do they read?

SmashingMag, .net, other design magazines

>What websited do they visit?

DesignerNews, awwwards, lifehacker

>What's this person's day like?

Spends a lot of time thinking about what they would rather be doing, like publishing
their content, how they're going to solve their next problem.

>What's the main dominant emotion this market feels?

Fear. There is so much to learn through the many steps of getting a website online.

>What is the ONE thing they crave above all else?

Clarity - user validation that what they've done is not only functional, but
worthwhile to read / interact with / buy from.

### My Message To My Target Market

You know how publishing your own website requires a domain name, a hosting account,
a way to connect them, and a way to get your files up there? Well what we do is
provide all four of those for a one-time fee, with the convenience of Dropbox
syncing. In fact, one customer was able to publish a website in fewer than 5 minutes.
